### Prevalence of negation in negative reviews 
Performed lexical analysis on negative and positive reviews of various datasets and found that negative reviews have more negations than positive reviews. Analyzed its implications on downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, style transfer in text. Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/Negation-in-negative-review)

### Tweet translation
Implemented Cross-alignment style transfer technique for twitter data to translate an input tweet to a better worded tweet with the same content. The output tweet may have a higher chance of getting retweeted. [Source code](https://github.com/madhu-aithal/language-style-transfer-pytorch)


### Clipboard Synchronization Application
I worked on developing an application for synchronizing the clipboard data across multiple devices of a user. The idea here is to provide a simple solution for users to copy a text such as a website URL, between their devices without much hassle. If a user copies a text in one of their devices, it will be available in the clipboard of other devices. We used electron.js and Angular for developing the cross-platform desktop application, Node.js and MongoDB as our backend with Keycloak for Identity and Access Management. We made use of sockets for synchronizing texts between multiple devices. We deployed our applications and services on Google Cloud Platform.

### Event sequence prediction
Implemented an LSTM based model for event sequence prediction on Twitter and Hawkes data. Analyzed its performance (NLL Loss) in comparison with the Neural Hawkes model. [Source code](https://github.com/CSCI-5922-DL-project)

### non-normal Recurrent Neural Networks
Performed hyperparameter explorations and ablation studies of nnRNNs. Implemented the Adding task for measuring the performance of nnRNNs against other RNN architectures. [Github repository](https://github.com/madhu-aithal/nnRNN_release)
